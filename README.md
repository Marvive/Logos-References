# Logos-refs Refined
![GitHub release (latest SemVer)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/Marvive/logos-refs-refined?style=for-the-badge&sort=semver)

- Simplify referencing and linking material from Logos Bible Software
- Easily aggregate bibtex references for your note
- **Refined Version**: Added customization settings for callouts, note titles, and Bible verse auto-detection.

## Example Use
Copy a passage from logos and utilize the paste command within logos-ref plugin, and automatically generate or reference a citation note.

## Setup notes
1. Make sure community plugins are turned on, and install the logos-refs-refined plugin
2. Under the logos-refs settings, set your reference directory (I like having a `refs` folder)
3. In Logos, under program settings, set citation style to `BibTeX Style`
4. You are ready to go!

## Development
This refined version is maintained by Michael Marvive. All bugs and feature requests should be filed under the [Issues](https://github.com/Marvive/logos-refs-refined/issues) in this repo.
